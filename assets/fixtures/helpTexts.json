As part of the NHANES, the CDC monitors biomarkers of chemical exposure (chiefly metabolites) in the blood and urine to quantify the levels of chemical compounds present in U.S. residents (<a href=' https://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/' target='_blank'>link</a>). Each two-year study cycle comprises approximately 10,000 individuals, with exposure biomarker data for any given chemical available from only a subset of roughly 1/3 of the individuals in the study. In the 2014 publication “High Throughput Heuristics for Prioritizing Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals” (<a href=' http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es503583j' target='_blank'>link</a>) EPA scientists inferred steady state exposure rates (mg/kg bodyweight) for 106 chemicals from the NHANES urine samples.

Analogues are ordered in decreasing order of similarity in a clockwise manner in the plot, starting with the most similar at the top. The similarity indices are annotated c (for chemistry) or b (for bioactivity) depending on the similarity context selected. Analogues may be identified using chemical descriptors or bioactivity descriptors. There are 3 different types of chemical descriptors included that are fingerprint representations of chemical structure - Morgan fingerprints, torsion fingerprints and chemotypes. Bioactivity descriptors make reference to a fingerprint representation of hitcalls from the ToxCast assays.
